<p>Getting banned from Fallout 76 can feel like wandering the Wasteland with no Stimpaks — frustrating and a little hopeless. But don’t worry! This simple guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal your ban for the best chance of reclaiming your vault and gear.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did your ban hit you faster than a Deathclaw ambush, or does it stick across every new account you try to create? You might be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! That means Fallout 76 has flagged your PC hardware, so even nabbing new accounts won’t get you back in the game.</p>
