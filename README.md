# How to Get Unbanned on Fallout 76 (2025 Guide) ⚒️

Getting banned from Fallout 76 can feel like wandering the Wasteland with no Stimpaks — frustrating and a little hopeless. But don’t worry! This simple guide will walk you through what to do if you’ve been banned and how to appeal your ban for the best chance of reclaiming your vault and gear.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban hit you faster than a Deathclaw ambush, or does it stick across every new account you try to create? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! That means Fallout 76 has flagged your PC hardware, so even nabbing new accounts won’t get you back in the game.

Using an HWID spoofer can be your ticket back into Appalachia if you’re stuck with a hardware ban.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your email or any notifications from Bethesda or Fallout 76 to see why you got flagged. Common reasons include:
- Cheating, using mods or third-party tools (outside of the allowed ones)
- Toxic or abusive behavior towards other players
- Account sharing or suspicious login activity

**Pro tip:** Make sure you read Bethesda’s Terms of Service before you send in an appeal.

## Step 2: Collect Your Information 📝

Before you reach out to Bethesda Support, have these ready:
- Your Bethesda account email address  
- Your Fallout 76 username or display name  
- The date you found out your account was banned  
- Any screenshots, error messages, or ban notices

## Step 3: Submit a Ban Appeal 📧

Head over to the [Bethesda Support Ban Appeal page](https://help.ea.com/en/help/account/information-about-banned-or-suspended-accounts/) and log in. Fill out their appeal form with your details. Alternatively, you can shoot Bethesda Support an email using this template:
